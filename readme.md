# VideoApp Starter - Alexa Skill Template

This is an Alexa skill template that provides a starting point for creating a skill that uses the [VideoApp Interface](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/videoapp-interface-reference.html) to stream native video files to an Amazon Echo Show or Echo Spot. To see this skill template in action, you can enable a live example by saying `Alexa, enable Visual Escape` and then `Alexa, open Visual Escape`.

### Using this template

This template was designed to be used with the [Alexa Skills Kit Command-Line Interface](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/ask-cli-intro.html) (aka: ASK-CLI). After installing the ASK-CLI you can run the following command to setup a new skill project based on this template.

`$ ask new --url http://skilltemplates.com/templates.json`

After running the previous command you'll see of list of templates to choose from. Pick the template named `VideoApp Starter`. This will create a new folder named `./videoapp-starter/` all of the code for the template will be located in that folder.
